          Fresh Meals is an Idea generated from the confusion we faced when we
          went to a new city and tried to have some food. There are several food
          items and many restaurants to choose from. We thought it would be nice
          to have an app that tells us what are the most famous dishes of that
          area in that particular season , and which restaurants produce that
          item.
