            Fresh Meals is an Idea generated from the confusion we faced when we
            went to a new city and tried to have some food. There are several
            food items and many restaurants to choose from. We thought it would
            be nice to have an app that tells us what are the most famous dishes
            of that area in that particular season , and which restaurants
            produce that item.
